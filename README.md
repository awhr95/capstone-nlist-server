# Project Title

NList

## Overview

NList is a place to discover and promote volunteering opportunities. The 'air-bnb' of volunteering.

### Problem

It is often hard and time consuming to find local opportunities to volunteer whether it is for charities, community events or local projects. Organisations and groups on the other hand also find it difficult to find volunteers.

Volunteering is siloed with small teams relying on the same pool of local volunteers. Local and community projects tend spread through word of mouth meaning limited scope and lack of diversity.

Onboarding onto a volunteer scheme can be long, analogue whilst organisations looks for the same information volunteers need to go through the same onboarding for each organisation. It is also diffucult to find local volunteering opportunities with no dedicated platform to support those looking for local volunteering opportunities

By lowering the barrier to entry for volunteers & providing and open and and transparent communication and onboarding, charities and community projects can increase thier pool of volunteers.

### User Profile

Charities, community groups & those looking to volunteer locally.

The app will be broken into two 'sides' one to browse and sign up to volunteer opportunities and one to 'host' and manage volunteer opportunities
